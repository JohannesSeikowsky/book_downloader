Downloading books from Project Gutenberg and the Internetarchive. 

The two main functions are "get_from_gutenberg" and "get_from_iarchive".
Each function has to be called with 2 arguments: 
1. The title of the book as you want it (e.g. "moby_dick")
2. A unqiue identifier of the book which you have to get online from project gutenberg/interneratchive.

Getting the identifiers:
- Gutenberg-proj - go to page of the book you want - the identifier is a number that you can find in the url.
- Internetarchive - go to page of the book you want - the identifier is on that page in the data section (scroll down), referenced as "identifier".
